# Blockchain
This Blockchain Repository covers blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), including foundational concepts, practical examples, and projects developed through Cyfrin Updraft by Patrick.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that securely records transactions across multiple computers, enabling trustless interactions without a central authority. Smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum automate and ensure transparent transactions.

## Repository Structure

- **`basics/`**: This directory includes essential blockchain and smart contract concepts. Much of the code here was originally written in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) as I explored Solidity basics, blockchain fundamentals, and simple contracts.
  

## Running the Code

To explore and run the code in this repository:
1. Install **Node.js** and **Truffle** (or another Ethereum development framework).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the desired folder (e.g., `basics/`) and review the `.sol` files. Follow standard steps for compiling and deploying using your preferred development environment, such as Remix IDE .
